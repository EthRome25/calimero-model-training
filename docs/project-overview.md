# MediNet - Decentralized Federated Learning for Medical Imaging

A short business overview

MediNet is a privacy-first platform that lets hospitals and research centers jointly train AI models on medical images without sharing patient data. Built on the Calimero Network (a private shard on NEAR), MediNet enables secure aggregation of local model updates so every participant benefits from a stronger global model while data never leaves the institution.

The problem we solve

- Medical AI needs large, diverse datasets, but data is sensitive (HIPAA/GDPR), siloed, and difficult to share. 
- As a result, each hospital trains in isolation, limiting accuracy and slowing innovation.

How MediNet works

- Local training: Each institution trains a model on its own CT/MRI data; raw data never leaves the premises.
- Secure aggregation: Encrypted model updates are sent via a Calimero private shard for privacy, auditability, and trust.
- Federated update: Aggregated weights produce a stronger global model distributed back to participants.
- Iterative cycles: Repeat to continuously improve performance without centralizing data.

Why Calimero Network

- Private shards for isolated, permissioned collaboration groups.
- Native NEAR integration for secure, transparent interactions.
- Modular stack with easy integration to PyTorch/TensorFlow workflows.
- Privacy by design: patient data stays on-prem.

Who benefits

- Hospitals and imaging centers seeking higher accuracy without data sharing.
- Research consortia and pharma needing collaborative model training across jurisdictions.
- Regulators and compliance teams that require auditability and privacy.

Business value

- Better model performance from pooled knowledge, not pooled data.
- Faster time-to-value vs. data-sharing agreements and central data lakes.
- Lower legal and compliance friction (HIPAA/GDPR aligned approach).
- Scales from a pilot of 2 institutions to large, multi-site networks.

Go-to-market (initial focus)

- Pilot with 2–5 hospitals on a single use case (e.g., lung nodule detection). 
- Demonstrate accuracy lift, privacy compliance, and operational fit.
- Expand via templates for additional imaging tasks and regions.

Summary

MediNet enables privacy-preserving, cross-institution AI training for medical imaging. Using Calimero Network for secure aggregation, stakeholders collaborate without exposing patient data—achieving better outcomes, faster, with compliance built-in.
