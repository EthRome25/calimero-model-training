nodes:
  chain_id: testnet-1
  count: 2
  image: ghcr.io/calimero-network/merod:edge
  prefix: calimero-node

steps:
  # Step 1: Install the application on the first node
  # This captures the application ID for use in subsequent steps
  - name: Install Application on Node 1
    type: install_application
    node: calimero-node-1
    path: logic/res/medical_ai_file_transfer.wasm
    dev: true
    outputs:
      app_id: applicationId # Export 'applicationId' field as 'app_id'

  # Step 2: Create a context using the installed application
  # Uses the captured application ID from step 1
  - name: Create Context on Node 1
    type: create_context
    node: calimero-node-1
    application_id: "{{app_id}}"
    outputs:
      context_id: contextId # Export 'contextId' field as 'context_id'
      member_public_key: memberPublicKey # Export 'memberPublicKey' as 'member_public_key'

  # Step 3: Generate an identity on the second node
  # This captures the public key for use in invitation and joining
  - name: Create Identity on Node 2
    type: create_identity
    node: calimero-node-2
    outputs:
      public_key: publicKey # Export 'publicKey' as 'public_key'

  # Step 4: Wait for identity creation to complete
  - name: Wait for Identity Creation
    type: wait
    seconds: 5

  # Step 5: Invite the second node to join the context
  # Uses captured values: context ID, member public key, and identity public key
  - name: Invite Node 2 from Node 1
    type: invite_identity
    node: calimero-node-1
    context_id: "{{context_id}}"
    grantee_id: "{{public_key}}"
    granter_id: "{{member_public_key}}"
    capability: member
    outputs:
      invitation: invitation # Export 'invitation' as 'invitation'

  # Step 6: Join the context from the second node
  # Uses captured values: context ID, invitee identity, and invitation data
  - name: Join Context from Node 2
    type: join_context
    node: calimero-node-2
    context_id: "{{context_id}}"
    invitee_id: "{{public_key}}"
    invitation: "{{invitation}}"

  # Step 7: Upload a sample ML model
  # Uses the member public key from the context as the executor
  - name: Upload Sample ML Model
    type: call

      is_public: true
    outputs:
      model_upload_result: result # Export 'result' as 'model_upload_result'

  # Step 8: Wait for the model upload to complete
  - name: Wait for Model Upload
    type: wait
    seconds: 3

  # Step 9: Upload a sample medical scan
  - name: Upload Sample Medical Scan
    type: call
    node: calimero-node-1

      uploader: "Dr. Johnson"
    outputs:
      scan_upload_result: result # Export 'result' as 'scan_upload_result'

  # Step 10: Wait for the scan upload to complete
  - name: Wait for Scan Upload
    type: wait
    seconds: 3

  # Step 11: Get application statistics
  - name: Get Application Stats
    type: call
    node: calimero-node-2
    context_id: "{{context_id}}"
    executor_public_key: "{{public_key}}"
    method: get_stats
